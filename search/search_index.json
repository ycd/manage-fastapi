Usage \u00b6 To get started right away with sensible defaults: fastapi startproject { name } You can run Manage FastAPI as a package if running it as a script doesn\u2019t work: python -m fastapi startproject { name } Command line options \u00b6 Manage FastAPI has three commands for now. You can list them by running fastapi --help : The idea is to have a highly customizable CLI, but at the same time a simple interface for new users. You can see the available options for startproject running fastapi startproject --help : The other commands are already available but the current implementation is too shallow. More details about startapp and run commands will be provided once they have more functionalities, at the moment you can run startapp by just: fastapi startapp { name } On the other hand, the run command expects you to have a startproject structure: fastapi run License \u00b6 This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.","title":"Manage FastAPI"},{"location":"#features","text":"","title":"Features \ud83d\ude80"},{"location":"#creates-customizable-project-boilerplate","text":"","title":"Creates customizable project boilerplate."},{"location":"#creates-customizable-app-boilerplate","text":"","title":"Creates customizable app boilerplate."},{"location":"#handles-the-project-structuring-for-you","text":"","title":"Handles the project structuring for you."},{"location":"#installation","text":"Manage FastAPI can be installed by running pip install manage-fastapi .
